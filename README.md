## üìñ Description

**Old Hollywood** is a web application that provides users with an engaging interface to explore classic Hollywood movies, allowing users to browse through different genres, watch trailers, and sign up for newsletters.

### **Prototype**:
The UX/UI design of the website was developed using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/h4pUlN8zaYDWveYhFy4stD/Untitled?node-id=14-1653&m=dev), and you are free to explore the components.

### **Frontend**: 
The frontend is built using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, delivering a seamless and responsive user experience.

### **Backend**:

- **Python** was used to set up and manage the database.
- **MySQL** was chosen as the database for storing movie data and user information.
- **Express and Node.js** were utilized to handle user authentication and API interactions.

The project is powered by data sourced from [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/), ensuring rich and up-to-date movie information.
